This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What I would like to do but didn't have time

I would use Redux for state management instead of local state (considering that task getting bigger)

I would definitely save data to local storage

I would like to add dropdown with existing companies/persons as an option for adding owners

I haven't manage to add editing mode for the companies/persons as well as feature of deleting them

I don't do a check for individuals for adding owners so you can add a Director or Shareholder to a person ;)

Obviously requires more styling

I would use SCSS for styling and organize it in "module" way
